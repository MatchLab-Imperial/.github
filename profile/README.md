## Welcome to MatchLab!

MatchLab is a research group focused on computer vision problems, in particular on tasks that require finding correspondences between images or videos i.e. matching, such as retrieval, localisation, 3D mapping, and recognition. We extensively use machine learning and deep learning in particular to advance fundamental research and engineer efficient systems for practical applications.
