## Welcome to MatchLab!

The MatchLab focuses on solving matching-based challenges in 3D vision by developing advanced techniques for invariant feature extraction and visual signal representation. Our work spans a broad range of computer vision tasks, including image and video classification, object recognition and tracking, visual surveillance, large-scale image retrieval, wide-baseline matching, face recognition, 3D reconstruction, and segmentation, among others.
